## About these dots
The dotfiles were inspired by Material You design. Accent colors are generated automatically when you change wallpaper, but there is an option to enter HEX value manually

## Important info, credits

This script is designed for the latest version of Arch and can be used on a freshly installed Arch system or on an already existing Hyprland setup.

This project is an improved version of [these beautiful dotfiles by koeqaife](https://github.com/koeqaife/hyprland-material-you). Also I used several scripts and configs from [JaKooLit's dotfiles](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland). 
I donâ€™t claim full authorship - I combined elements I liked and added a few personal touches.

## What was changed

- **Changed clock format to 12-hour clock format, added seconds (to taskbar and hyprlock)**.
- **Added installation and configuration of zsh**.
- **Added kitty configuration**.
- **More wallpapers**.
- And many other minor changes...

## How to install

First, you must have Arch installed. This can be a minimal installation without Hyprland or any DE/WM. Then:
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -Syu
   sudo pacman -S git
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ayukuro/hyprdots.git
   cd hyprdots
   ./install.sh
